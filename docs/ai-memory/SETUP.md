# AI Memory setup for Cursor (GithubArchiver)

Adapted from the open-source AI Memory Vault approach (boot file + structured vault + job priming) for Cursor. The boot layer here is **Project Rules** in `.cursor/rules/` instead of a root `CLAUDE.md`. Daily-note updates on every coding chat are intentionally optional — store durable outcomes only.

## Layout (outside code repos)

Create once on your machine:

```text
C:\AI-Memory\
├── VAULT-INDEX.md
├── AI-BOOT.md
├── 00 - Inbox\
├── 01 - Daily Notes\
├── 02 - Projects\
│   ├── GithubArchiver\
│   ├── SiegeQueue\
│   ├── Inventory App\
│   └── Personal\
├── 03 - Knowledge\
├── 04 - Jobs\
├── 05 - People\
└── 99 - Archive\
```

Bootstrap GithubArchiver notes by copying:

```text
docs/ai-memory/seed/ → C:\AI-Memory\
```

Optional: set `AI_MEMORY_VAULT=C:\AI-Memory` so Cursor Cloud Agents and other environments can find the same vault path convention (`$HOME/AI-Memory` is also accepted).

## Structured checkpoints (event log)

Each durable event is one append-only markdown file with queryable frontmatter:

`date`, `pr`, `commit`, `area`, `type`, `status`, `supersedes`, `related`, `id`, …

See `entries/SCHEMA.md`. Prefer adding a new entry over rewriting history.

Types include: `decision`, `incident`, `migration`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `performance`, `refactor`, `test`, `release`, `technical-debt`, `research`.

Regenerate derived views after adding an entry:

```bash
npm run memory:timeline
```

Primary generated artifacts:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Timeline.md` | Chronological event log |
| `Current Status.md` | Living summary (open work, debt, recent merges) |
| `Project Digest.md` | Single AI-priming document |
| `Knowledge Graph.md` | `related` / `supersedes` link map |
| `index.json` | Machine-readable index for agents/tooling |

Plus convenience indexes (`PR Timeline.md`, `Production Incidents.md`, …) and `indexes/<type>.md`.

### Retrieval (PR #10–#12)

Multi-stage pipeline (scales past naive full-graph walks):

```text
Query → candidates (top K) → typed expand → re-rank → token-budget assemble
```

```bash
npm run memory:query -- "search fallback"
npm run memory:query -- "search fallback" --budget 6000
npm run memory:query -- "search fallback" --follow caused-by,references
npm run memory:query -- "search fallback" --include-hypotheses
```

Typed edges (`caused-by`, `implemented-by`, `supersedes`, `references`, `validates`) let agents ask for root cause without treating every link equally. Explicit `durability` separates permanent knowledge from temporary status.

Default confidence filter: **confirmed only**.

Principle: **make important things easy to rediscover** — smarter retrieval beats a larger vault.

## What to store (and what not to)

Store only durable things:

- confirmed decisions
- architecture
- production failures and fixes
- merged PRs / deployment results
- migrations
- unresolved technical debt

Do **not** force daily-note updates on every coding chat — that creates noisy memory.

Never store secrets, tokens, or credentials in the vault.

## Daily Cursor prompts that work well

Start:

```text
Read the GithubArchiver project memory and inspect the relevant code. Do not edit anything yet. Explain the current behavior and propose a plan.
```

Implement:

```text
Implement the plan, add regression coverage, run the relevant tests, and update Current Status.md with the durable result.
```

Finish:

```text
Create a concise checkpoint in the project memory with what changed, why, tests, deployment status, and remaining verification.
```
